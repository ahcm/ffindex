* Overview

FFindex is a very simple index/database for huge amounts of small files. The
files are stored concatenated in one big data file, seperated by '\0'. A second
file contains a plain text index, giving name, offset and length of of the
small files. The lookup is currently done with a binary search on an array made
from the index file.


* Installation
 
$ cd src
$ make
$ make test

On OS X use for the first make line:
$ make -f Makefile.osx

# Please use a sensible value for INSTALL_DIR, e.g. /usr/local or /opt/ffindex
# or $HOME/ffindex instead of "..".
$ make install INSTALL_DIR=.. 


* Usage

Please note that before querying or unlinking entries a ffindex must be
sorted, although you can add to it without. So either specify -s with
ffindex_build or sorted later with ffindex_modify -s.

Setup environment:
$ export PATH="$INSTALL_DIR/bin:$PATH"
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$INSTALL_DIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
On OS X set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH instead of LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Build index from files in test/data and test/data2.
$ ffindex_build -s /tmp/test.data /tmp/test.ffindex test/data test/data2

Retrieve three entries:
$ ffindex_get  /tmp/test.data /tmp/test.ffindex a b foo

Unlink (Remove reference from index) an entry:
$ ffindex_modify -u /tmp/test.ffindex b

Retrieve three entries, "b" should now be missing:
$ ffindex_get /tmp/test.data /tmp/test.ffindex a b foo
